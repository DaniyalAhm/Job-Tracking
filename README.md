# Job-Tracking

Job-Tracking is a project designed to streamline the process of managing and analyzing job applications. It leverages data preprocessing, entity recognition, and classification techniques to provide insights into job application data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw job application data for analysis.
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies and extracts key entities from job descriptions and applications.
- **Classification**: Categorizes job applications based on predefined criteria to facilitate better organization and decision-making.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaniyalAhm/Job-Tracking.git
   cd Job-Tracking
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Use the `PreProcessing_Data.ipynb` notebook to clean and prepare your raw data.

2. **Entity Recognition**:

   - Run the `Entity_Recog.ipynb` notebook to extract key entities from the job application data.

3. **Classification**:

   - Execute the `Classification.ipynb` notebook to categorize the processed job applications.

Detailed instructions and explanations are provided within each notebook to guide you through the process.
